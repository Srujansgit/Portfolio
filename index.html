                <p>
                    Hi, I’m Srujan, a 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student from Bengaluru with a deep passion for DevOps, cloud technologies, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and related tools. I thrive on teamwork, creativity, and adaptability, which make me a strong problem solver and collaborator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m well-versed in programming languages like C, Java, Go, and PL/SQL, and have a solid grasp of Data Structures and Algorithms. My technical expertise extends to tools and platforms like AWS, AutoCAD, Vivado, Eclipse, VS Code, and Oracle SQL. Additionally, I have in-depth knowledge in areas such as Digital System Design, Computer Networks, Database Management, Deep Learning, Operating Systems, and Formal Languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond the technical realm, I am passionate about teaching, traveling, and sports, including football and basketball. Having represented my school and college teams, I believe in the power of discipline, strategy, and collaboration both on and off the field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re looking for a dedicated engineer to bring innovative solutions to your projects, a tutor to share knowledge, or even just a teammate for a football or basketball match, I’d love to connect with you. Let’s build something amazing together!
